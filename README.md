"This web application is made using Java Core, JDBC (JAVA DATABASE CONNECTIVITY), Servlets, JSP (JAVA SERVER PAGES), and JSTL (JAVA STANDARD TAG LIBRARY).

The project will start with the creation of a homepage that provides an overview of the blog and its purpose. The homepage will include links to various categories of articles such as software development, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and others. It will also include a search bar and a section for displaying recent posts.

The blog will also have an author dashboard that allows writers to create and edit their posts. The dashboard will include a text editor for creating and formatting posts and other media. It will also have a preview feature to enable authors to see how their posts will appear on the blog before publishing and make it easy to find related content. The blog will also have a commenting system that allows readers to engage with the authors and other readers by leaving comments on the posts. Users can update their profile details. There is an admin page where the admin has access to edit and delete user information. The admin can also edit and delete post data and perform other functions. The project will be hosted on GitHub and will be open source, allowing contributors to submit pull requests to improve the codebase or add new features. The blog will also be optimized for search engines to increase its visibility and attract more readers."
